Votings are working fine.


1. Deleting Voting Pod:

 -> After deleting vote pod, Replica set is created another pod with new container and app is still running with the new container.

2. Deleting Worker pod:

 -> Still there is no issue in the application, able to vote and getting the results. New worker pod got created when it is deleted.

3. Deleting DB pod:

 -> We lost the votes which we are voted previously. (worker node got restarted)
 -> Able to vote but not reflecting in the results page.
 -> Lost the connection between the db pod and result pod.

 -> To get back the results, delete the result pod, so that the new pod get created and search for new db pod and connects to that.

 -> Now we will get all votes which are recorded after worker restart.
