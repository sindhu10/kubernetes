1. Replica Set:

Replica Set will create set of pods specified in config and run all the time. If we delete one pod will create new pod with running status.

Daemon set will manage the working nodes and pods, it ensure that a node should have a pod.


2. Deployment:


[root@ip-172-31-16-169 09-deployments]# kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 10}}'
deployment.apps/kubia patched

->updating image
[root@ip-172-31-16-169 09-deployments]# kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2
deployment.apps/kubia image updated



3.Services:


nodeport is internally using service ip to fetch the working pod. 

So we should check all the specifications in replicaset yml file like nodeport, service ip, target port. 
All the specifications should match with application specifications like ports etc
